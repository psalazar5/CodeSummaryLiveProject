# CodeSummaryLiveProject

## Introduction
For the last two weeks of my time at the tech academy, I worked with my peers in a team developing a full scale MVC Web Application in C#. Working with my scrum master in Azure devops I managed to build a code first entity framework database, CRUD functionality pages to various sections of the website to allow information managemenent, using ASP.NET MVC. There were some big changes that could have been a large time sink, but we used what we had to deliver what was needed on time. I saw how a good developer works with what they have to make a quality product and what does not . I worked on several [back end stories](#back-end-stories) that I am very proud of. Because much of the site had already been built and already in its middle of its life cycle, there were also a good deal of [front end stories](#front-end-stories) improvements that needed to be completed, all of varying degrees of difficulty. Everyone on the team had a chance to work on front end and back end stories, this was a WIP, as well as regularily using version control: updating master branch, updating the master in git changes(pulling down my new branch from Azure to local machine), then searching for it in branch list(after making local changes), pushing up the branch, finally creating a pull request.  

  
Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and navigation links. I also have some full code files in this repo for the larger functionalities I implemented.


## Back End Stories
* [Code First Entity Framework Database](#code-first-entity-framework)
* [Scaffolding CRUD Pages](#scaffolding-crud-pages)

### Code First Entity Framework 
In this part of WIP project I had to create a model for a Rental History page including CRUD functionality. There were two parts to this story, first creating an entity model for the RentalHistory class so it can be saved into the database, then scaffolding CRUD pages for it and using SQL Server to check if the table had been created accordingly.

### Scaffolding CRUD Pages 
This is the second part where I scaffolded the CRUD pages for it's functionality and it's final result:
